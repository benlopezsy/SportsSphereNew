                <h2>Sixers announce rookie Jared McCain is out for season with torn meniscus</h2>
                <p>
                    Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared McCain was on his way to being a Rookie of the Year candidate this season. (He declared himself the winner in mid-November.)

                    However, his promising debut campaign will be cut short by a torn meniscus. On Thursday, the team announced his season is over.
                        
                </p>
                <p>
                    McCain suffered the torn meniscus in his left knee on Dec. 13 during a 121-107 loss to the Indiana Pacers. He underwent surgery to repair the tear and his return was indefinite. Repairing the meniscus was better for McCain's long-term prognosis with the injury. However, it also meant there would be a longer recovery.

                <blockquote>
                    “I think we’ve got to try to keep things long term, is what’s most important," Sixers coach Nick Nurse said shortly before McCain had surgery, via NBC Sports Philadelphia. "How does this affect him going forward in his career, which we hope is many, many years?

                    "You never really get a chance to go back and win the Rookie of the Year award," he added. "That’s a major one to have. You get that thing and you have it for the rest of your life, that at one point in time you were the Rookie of the Year. It’s obviously a tough way to go out, not having that."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Losing McCain for the season is the latest bad news in what's been a nightmare season for the Sixers. The team and its fans had championship aspirations with the Big Three of Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and offseason addition Paul George.
