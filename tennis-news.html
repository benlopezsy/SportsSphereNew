                    Cameron Norrie, the British tennis star, let his frustrations boil over during his defeat at the Auckland Classic, dramatically throwing his racket into the crowd. The incident came after a tough match, marking a rare display of anger from the usually composed player.

                    The 29-year-old got away with a warning from the umpire and went on to lose the Auckland Classic match 6-2, 6-3 to Facundo Diaz Acosta.
