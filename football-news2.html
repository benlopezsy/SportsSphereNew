                <h1>Everton sack manager Sean Dyche 3 hours <br>before defeating Peterborough in FA Cup<br> 3rd round!</h1>

            <h3>Sean Dyche has been sacked as Everton manager after less<br> than two years in charge at Goodison Park.</h3>
            <p>
                The 53-year-old's departure was announced just hours before Everton<br> were due to host League One side Peterborough in the third round of the <br>FA Cup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everton announced their under-18s head coach Leighton Baines and club<br> captain Seamus Coleman had been put in charge of the team for that game.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Right-back Coleman and former left-back Baines have made more than 800<br> Everton appearances between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four members of Dyche's coaching staff - Ian Woan, Steve Stone, Mark <br>Howard and Billy Mercer - have also departed.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The Toffees were beaten 1-0 by Bournemouth on Saturday and sit 16th in<br> the Premier League and just one point clear of the relegation zone.  
            </p>
            <p>
                They failed to register a shot on target at Vitality Stadium and have won just<br> three of 19 games in the league this season.  
            </p>
            <p>
                A source close to the Friedkin Group - which <b><u>completed a Â£400m takeover</u></b><br> of the club last month - told BBC Sport the new owners had been in talks with<br> Dyche over a couple of days this week, with both sides feeling they had<br> reached the end of the road. Difficult negotiations took place over an exit<br> package for Dyche and his staff before a settlement was reached. 
            </p>
           <p>
            The source added that the timing of Dyche's departure, just hours before a game, <br>was not ideal.
           </p>
           <p>
            BBC Sport has approached Dyche - who was at Everton's training ground earlier<br> on Thursday - for comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Club sources say they want Dyche's replacement to have Premier League<br>  experience and former Everton manager David Moyes is among the names<br>  to have been linked.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, sources close to Jose Mourinho have ruled the Fenerbahce manager<br>  out of contention.
           </p>
           <p>
            The former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham boss previously worked<br>  under the Friedkin Group at Roma, but he was sacked by them in January 2024.
