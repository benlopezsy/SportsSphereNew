                <h2>Australian Open: Britain's Harriet Dart and Billy Harris into final qualifying round, Heather Watson out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the men's qualifying, British men's No 4 Billy Harris also eased through to the final round of qualifying for the loss of just three games against Spain's Carlos Taberner, in a little over an hour 6-1, 6-2.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harris is looking to reach the main draw for the first time, having fallen in the second round of qualifying last year.

                    He will face Poland's Kamil Majchrzak in the final round on Thursday.
                    
                    Dart came from behind in a see-saw match against Australian teenager Taylah Preston to clinch her spot in the final qualifying round.
                    She narrowly lost the first set tie-break having already fought from going down an early break in the first set, but raced through the next two sets to win 6-7 (7-9), 6-1 6-2.

                    Dart will play Japan's Nao Hibino to make the main draw for the fifth time in her career, with a best performance of the second round in 2020.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Watson started strongly in her match against America's Varvara Lepchenko, winning the first set before Lepchenko fought back to end the Briton's campaign.

                    The Briton broke early in the first set and held on to her advantage but Lepchenko broke in the second set to level the match, before breaking Watson three times in succession to close out the match 3-6 6-3 6-1.
